# 🎬 Zenith Movies (Ad-Free Scraper)

A simple movie streaming frontend that pulls video sources using scripts originally based on Vidlink. This version removes ads and provides a clean, minimal playback experience.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎥 Stream movies directly in-browser
* ⚡ Fast loading using HLS streams
* 🚫 No ads (cleaned version of original scripts)
* 🌐 Deployed easily with Vercel
* 🔗 Simple URL-based playback system

## 🧠 How It Works

This project uses a scraping/proxy approach to retrieve video streams and display them in a native HTML5 player.

Example:

```
https://your-site.vercel.app/?id=550
```

* `id` = Movie ID (typically from TMDB or similar source)
* The app fetches and injects the stream into a video player
* Playback is handled using HLS
